1 - Given a task in the project you’re working on, it’s your first time implementing a featurelike this so you search the internet for a solution and you find two open source libraries which could help you implement this task. How would you choose which one to use?

==> I would read about the two libraries and know how both work, so that I have more information which might help me for future issues. And for the main current task, after reading about both libraries, I will choose the one which will make the project more efficient whatever in used memory, time complixity , speed and more.


2- If there’s one improvement you can add to your favorite programming language orframework, what would that be?

==> I have worked with auth0 as third party security program to secure a website project in python, but it did return only part of clients data and the important data wasn't accessed even by website owner but it was accessed by auth0 itself. So, I can't git my clients data and can't analysis their data like communication companies. So I want to enhace myself in python security to be create as best as security for my website and control data, also save my clients data safe.


3- StarWars or Star Trek?

==> Is there is no third choice? Ok, I would choose [StarWars].
